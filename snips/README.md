## About

Snips.ai is an AI-powered voice assistant that runs on the Raspberry Pi 3 and x86 platforms.
In contrast to Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, it runs on-device and is private by design.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is straightforward and easy to do.

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Hass.io** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "Snips.AI" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

Home Assistant comes with certain Intents builtin to handle common tasks. A complete list of Intents can be found in this wiki [Hass Snips Bundle](https://github.com/tschmidty69/hass-snips-bundle-intents/wiki).

The Snips add-on by default comes with an assistant that allows you to turn on lights or switches, open covers, or add and list items to a [Shopping List](/integrations/shopping_list/) if that integration is enabled.

If using a USB microphone and speakers plugged into the Raspberry Pi output, Snips will work without any change to the configuration. Trying saying things like:

```txt
Turn on kitchen light
Open garage door
What is on my shopping list
```

To get started creating your own configuration, follow [their tutorial](https://docs.snips.ai/getting-started/quick-start-console) to create an assistant and download the training data. You can also add the Home Assistant Skill to your assistant to enable the built-in intents, and add or create your own intents to do more complex tasks.

Now install and activate the [Samba](/addons/samba/) add-on so you can upload your training data. Connect to the "share" Samba share and copy your assistant over. Name the file `assistant.zip` or whatever you have configured in the configuration options.

Now it's time to start Snips for the first time. You can configure the microphone and sound card using the Add-on interface. Now start the add-on.
